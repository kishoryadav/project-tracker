## What is the Steem-FOSSbot organisation?

Steem FOSSbot (Free Open Source bot), is a software ecosystem which comprises of solutions for automation on Steem. These are bots in the wide sense of the word, probably close to the definition put forward by [Incapsula](https://www.incapsula.com/blog/understanding-bots-and-your-business.html):

> A bot , also known as Internet bot, is a program that runs automated tasks over the Internet. Typically intended to perform simple and repetitive tasks, Internet bots are scripts and programs that enables their user to do things quickly and on a scale. For example, search engines like Google, Bing, Yandex or Baidu use crawler bots to periodically collect information from hundreds of millions of domains and index it into their result pages.

However the more [imaginative and people-like the bot](https://steemit.com/bots/@personz/all-singing-all-dancing-bots-act-1), the more interesting it will be!

## Flagship project, Voter

[_Voter_](https://github.com/Steem-FOSSbot/steem-fossbot-voter) is the first and most central piece of this, as it is the **curration 'bot'** which actually decides which posts to vote on, and also performs the voting action.
